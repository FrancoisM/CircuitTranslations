## Style Guide

### Keep things short

Most of the text is presented in dialog boxes on phones so keeping
translations short is preferable to being verbose.

Acronymns, initialisms, and common abbreviations are all welcome so long
as they would be recognized by beginners in electronics.

### Prefer spaces over hyphenations

If compound words can either be hyphenated or combined with space,
prefer space. This is to help the rendering engine layout text properly.
